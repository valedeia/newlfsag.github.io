<p class="card-text">
<p>The staff of the Laboratory of Experimental Phonetics <i>Arturo Genre</i> works in various domains within the fields of acoustic and articulatory phonetics.</p>

<p>Our chief interest concerns the <b>suprasegmental aspects of speech, mainly intonation and rhythm</b>. This is the cause of our participation in the <a href="../ricerca/amper-ita/#/">AMPER project</a> and of our numerous works on the <a href="../ritmo/index_en.html">acoustic correlates of natural languages' rhythm</a> (see for instance <a href="../correlatore/index_en.html"> Correlatore</a>).</p>

<p>The <b>phonetic transcription</b> is another domain in which we are particularly active. <a href="../laboratorio/equipe_en.html">Antonio Romano</a> has taken part in the <b>labelling of some corpora of spoken Italian</b> (within the CLIPS project) and has recently published the results of an evaluation of the materials contained in AVIP and C-ORAL-ROM (Rivista Italiana di Linguistica 19/2). Since 2002 he has directed a workshop of Applied Phonetics at the Faculty of Foreign Languages and Literatures of the University of Turin, where he is currently testing a multi-level annotation model to be used by students of foreign languages.</p>

<p>Many of our contributions concern <b>Romance dialectology</b> (such as the phonetic characteristics of some <b>Piedmontese, Salentinian and Lucan varieties</b>, as well as socio-linguistic aspects of <b>griko</b>).</p>

<p>Moreover, we have contributed to the study of some languages that still lack a comprehensive and easily available scientific description (such as <b>Ditammari</b> and <b>Kirundi</b>).</p>

<p>Although our Laboratory can boast a solid tradition of <b>acoustic phonetics</b>, we are getting more and more interested in <b>instrumental articulatory phonetics</b>; in particular, we are currently making use of <a href="../mri/index_en.html">MRI</a>.</p>
